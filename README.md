# BeLander
Land drones with precision using homing technology<br>
For Project Aeolus 2021

## Premise / Concept
Drones equiped with the propper receiver can view signals being sent by the beacon at the landing pad. Once they align on the x-y plane with that beacon, they can then land keeping it center to land with precision. It can also be used for distance telemetry, i guess.
